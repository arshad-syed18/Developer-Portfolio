This is a React-based portfolio project that utilizes ThreeJS to display animations and bring the website to life using Framer Motion. 
It also uses TailwindCSS and other libraries, and is currently in development.
Used a computer desk 3D model and a model of the earth. In addition to having icosahedron balls represent the technologies on each tech. Redners just circles on mobile devices due to limited processing power of mobiles.
